# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 1000 (from the original 50000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

```
This code simulates a simplified model to demonstrate how contact tracing can lead to a biased understanding of COVID-19 infection sources. It models a community of 1000 people attending weddings or brunches, with an infection rate of 10%. Through primary contact tracing, where infections have a 20% chance of being traced, and secondary contact tracing, where events with multiple traced infections lead to full tracing, the code shows how the observed proportion of infections traced to weddings can appear significantly higher than the true proportion. By running the simulation 50,000 times, the resulting histograms reveal this bias, underscoring the challenge of accurately identifying infection sources through contact tracing in real-world scenarios.
